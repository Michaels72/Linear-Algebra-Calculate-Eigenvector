Casting neural networks as matrices and vectors enables one to utilize many of the properties of matrices and vectors to compactly handle computations.  They also play an essential role in neural networks.  Vectors and matrices help by compressing all the calculations into very simple notations and their operations are fast and easy, especially when training on GPUs.  Matrix multiplication is one of the most important operations in deep learning.
